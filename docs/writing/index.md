# Writing assignments/docs/thesis/etc


During the MSc Geomatics, you'll have to write reports, assignments, an MSc thesis, documentation for code, etc.

While you could use Microsoft Word for those, we do __not__ recommend it!


[Markdown :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](markdown.md){ .md-button }
Best for documentation (*this website is written in Markdown, see [its source code](https://github.com/tudelft3d/geogeeks/)*)

[LaTeX :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](latex.md){ .md-button }
Best for MSc thesis and for assignment reports

[Typst :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](typst.md){ .md-button }
The "new LaTeX", great in 1-2y; live on the cutting edge!
