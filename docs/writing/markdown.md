# Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a simple and easy-to-read language for formatting plain text.

It is widely used to write documentation and research papers (eg see [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)), GitHub uses it as the default for README files, and many websites are written in Markdown (before being automatically converted to HTML).

The geogeeks website is written in Markdown, see [the source of this page](https://github.com/tudelft3d/geogeeks/edit/main/docs/writing/markdown.md)!

## Markdown: basic + extended versions

The [original Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is rather limited, but it has been extended by several to add more complex features (like tables,  code-blocks, or [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/)).

Watch out, it's a bit the far-west out there: some processors might not be able to parse your flavour of Markdown correctly!?

!!! external-link "GitHub Flavoured Markdown"
    GitHub offers an useful overview of the features they added for their extended version called "[GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting)".
