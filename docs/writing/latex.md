# LaTeX


## LaTeX installation


### Online environment: Overleaf

[![](img/overleaf.png)](https://overleaf.com)

To start, we recommend you use the [online LaTeX environment Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) since it has a full installation of LaTeX and there is nothing to install.
If you login with your TUDelft email, you get extra features (TUDelft pays for it).

### Local installation

If you want to use LaTeX locally (it's faster to compile) then you need either:

  - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) 
  - [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (macOS). 
  - [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (Linux)


!!! warning 

    For small documents Overleaf is great. But it becomes rather slow for medium to large documents, and then using LaTeX locally is probably a better idea.


## Getting started

The best is to follow the [Overleaf's Learn LaTeX in 30min](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to start.

The only crucial thing missing from it is how to add references, for this we suggest you use "natbib" ([tutorial about bibliography management with natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib)).


## Tips and tricks for LaTeX

:material-download-box-outline: [this simple demo](https://github.com/tudelft3d/latex-getting-started/tree/main/template) gives you tips and tricks to do most of the useful things in LaTeX.

Use it as the template for submitting your homeworks for instance.

    LaTeX is great but there are often 37 ways to accomplish something... The template we give you shows you what we think is "the best to do X"
